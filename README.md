# Talk

A simple chat application built with React and an Express API.

This is a recreation of my other [app](https://github.com/rejnowicz281/react-chat-rails) also built with React but with a Ruby On Rails API. In this one I used NodeJS and Express for the API.

Link to the API [here](https://github.com/rejnowicz281/talk-api)
